Before proceeding with any CSS code changes, please ensure the following conventions are followed:

[CSS CONVENTIONS]

1. NAMING CONVENTIONS & ORGANIZATION
- Consistent CSS variable naming
- Unified prefixing strategy (e.g., --color-, --font-, --space-)
- Consistent multi-word conventions (kebab-case recommended)
- Semantic naming that describes purpose, not appearance
- Logical grouping and organization of variables
- Consistent Tailwind CSS variable mapping
- All Tailwind config references match actual CSS variables
- No undefined variable references
- Consistent referencing patterns across the config

2. CSS BEST PRACTICES
- Color System
    - Consistent color value formats (hex vs. RGB space-separated)
    - Proper color contrast ratios (WCAG 2.1 AA: 4.5:1 for normal text)
    - Semantic color naming (primary, secondary, success, error)
    - Support for alpha transparency where needed
- Typography System
    - Consistent font size scale
    - Proper line height ratios
    - Web-safe font fallbacks
    - Responsive typography considerations
- CSS Custom Properties
    - Fallback values provided for critical variables
    - Proper cascade and inheritance usage
    - Scoped variables where appropriate
    - No unused CSS variables

3. TAILWIND CONFIGURATION
- Content Scanning
    - All relevant file paths included in the content array
    - No unnecessary paths that could slow build
    - Proper file extensions specified
- Theme Extension
    - Logical extension of the default theme
    - No overriding of useful defaults unnecessarily
    - Consistent with design system tokens
    - Proper TypeScript typing with `satisfies Config`
- Performance Optimization
    - No unused custom utilities
    - Efficient color palette (not overly large)
    - Proper tree-shaking considerations

4. RESPONSIVE DESIGN
- Breakpoint System
    - Logical breakpoint progression
    - Consistent with common device sizes
    - Mobile-first approach implemented
    - Container queries considered where appropriate
- Spacing System
    - Consistent spacing scale
    - Proper responsive spacing utilities
    - Logical progression (4px, 8px, 16px, 32px, etc.)

5. ACCESSIBILITY
- Motion & Animation
    - `prefers-reduced-motion` media query implemented
    - Animations can be disabled for accessibility
    - No motion that could trigger vestibular disorders
